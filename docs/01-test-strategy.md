# üåç World-Class Best Practice Test Framework (Goblin)

This framework shows **when** each test happens, **what** it checks, and how it relates to release readiness gates.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Development
- Static Code Analysis (SAST)
- Unit Testing
- Component Testing
- Code Reviews / Pair Programming

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Build Verification
- Smoke Testing
- Sanity Testing (optional)

---

## Phase 3 ‚Äì QA / Functional Validation
- Regression Testing
- Integration Testing
- System / End-to-End Testing
- Exploratory Testing

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Non-Functional Testing
- Performance (load, stress, soak, scalability)
- Compatibility / Cross-Browser / Cross-Device
- Accessibility (WCAG/ADA)
- Chaos / Resilience
- Data Migration (if relevant)

---

## Phase 5 ‚Äì Security & Compliance
- Dynamic App Security Testing (DAST)
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Compliance Testing (PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

---

## Phase 6 ‚Äì Business Validation
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Alpha/Beta Testing

---

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Operational Readiness
- Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT)
- Failover / Disaster Recovery Testing
- Deployment Testing (Blue-Green, Canary)

---

## Phase 8 ‚Äì Production / Post-Release
- Monitoring & Observability
- Continuous Pen Testing / Red Teaming
- User Feedback & Telemetry
- Periodic Regression / Compliance Audits
