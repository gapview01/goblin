# Goblin — Solana Agent Wallet
Not an app, a money creature.

This is the **front door** to the Goblin ecosystem: a minimal map of what Goblin is, how it’s structured, and where to find the code.

- Vision & layers: see **ARCHITECTURE.md**
- Repos & links: see **REPO-MAP.md**
- Bucket 4 (Governance & Economics): **goblin-treasury** *(private)* — treasury ops runbooks

We keep Goblin modular and open. Critical ops remain private.
